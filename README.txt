This repository has some codes made for the Arduino Uno R3 board and its purpose is to give more material for studies/projects.

Since this repo is under development, you can send me suggestions/corrections/anything you can do to help me!

I take no responsability for any damage or problem that may happen to your board, although these sketches are not supposed
to cause any damage. Just make shure you are doing things correclty.

It is worth it to mention the following websites:

- www.arduinoevilgenius.com
which has a lot of sketches (go to Downloads->evil_genius.zip)! Also, I recomend you to buy the book "30 arduino
projects for the evil genius". This is a good start if you are having your first contact with electronics and Arduino.

- http://www.ealnet.com/m-eal/resistor/resistor.htm
is a website to calculate a resistor's resistance.

If you want to help me or just ask for something, please, feel free to contact me anytime!
