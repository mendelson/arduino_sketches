This code is nothing but a variation of the "blink" example. A very basic example.

Hardware:
- 1x LED;
- 1x 330 Ohms resistor;
- Sorted wires.

Mounting:
Put the negative leg of the LED connected to the resistor. The other side of the resistor goes on GND.
The positive leg of the LED goes on pin 12.
