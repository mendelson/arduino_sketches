This repository has some codes made for the Arduino Uno R3 board and its purpose is to give more material for studies/projects.

Since this repo is under development, you can send me suggestions/corrections/anything you can do to help me!

I take no responsability for any damage or problem that may happen to your board, although these sketches are not supposed
to cause any damage. Just make shure you are doing things correclty.

===> Folders:
1) Codes: it contains all the codes.
2) Libraries: it contains external libraries that you'll have to install manually (they are not included in the standard IDE installation).
3) Theoretical Material & documentation: it has some extra material and documentation.

===> It is worth it to mention the following websites:
- https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QAnRPXTugEvdDgsOVwRVynd0hqM2rvqbVK4Y1kTAQ8k/viewform
is the link for a form I have created. So, even if you haven't used these codes, please, answer at least the question "How did you find this repo?", it will be very usefull for me! Thanks!

if you want to, you can also download this repository's content as a ".zip" file.

- http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXC9VeDSdt4QM3OWGdXhb5ZWy_J9Ynf87
is the youtube playlist of the projects I've made so far.

- http://fritzing.org/download/
is the link for you to download "fritzing": the software I use to create schematics.

- www.arduinoevilgenius.com
which has a lot of sketches (go to Downloads->evil_genius.zip)! Also, I recomend you to buy the book "30 arduino
projects for the evil genius". This is a good start if you are in your first contact with electronics and Arduino.

- http://www.ealnet.com/m-eal/resistor/resistor.htm
is a website to calculate a resistor's resistance.

If you want to help me or just ask for something, please, feel free to contact me anytime!
