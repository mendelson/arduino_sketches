In each directory, you will find a "content.txt" which has a brief explanation of what that code does.

This is the list of the codes you can find here (up to now):

01 - blinking led;
02 - string to morse code converter;
03 - traffic and pedestrian signal (using a switch button with debouncing);
04 - binary clock.

Feel free to use all of these codes in anything you want, as long as you contact me (see README.txt).
