In this project, we will build a simple binary clock, with hours, minutes and seconds.
See it on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdZVjF-HJFw

The rules are:
When the clock is turned on, it'll wait for you to enter any data for about 10 seconds. If data is entered (and if the
time you typed is valid), the clock will start working from this typed time. If you don't enter any data, the clock will
start at 00:00:00 (it allows you to turn it on without a computer, so you don't have to type anything).

Also, it is possible to attach a keyboard, so that you can type the initial time. I encourage you to do this (and send me
your code, as well!). Since all I have is an Arduino Uno, there are no extra pins for me to implement this.


Hardware:
- 7x red LEDs;
- 7x green LEDs;
- 6x yellow LEDs;
- 20x 330 Ohms resistor;
- Sorted Wires.

Mounting:
Put a 330 Ohms resistor in series with each one of the LEDs. The other resistor's leg goes on GND. The pins in which each
LED has to be conected can be seen in the youtube video or by analising the code.
