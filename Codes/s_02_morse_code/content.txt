In this project, we will be able to type a message and convert it into morse code.
See it on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4jcGJj8ufk

Some of the rules of Morse code are that a dash is three times as long as a dot, the time between each dash or dot is
equal to the duration of a dot, the space between two letters is the same length as a dash, and the space between two
words is the same duration as seven dots.

Hardware:
- 1x LED;
- 1x 330 Ohms resistor;
- Sorted wires.

Mounting:
Put the negative leg of the LED connected to the resistor. The other side of the resistor goes on GND.
The positive leg of the LED goes on pin 12.
